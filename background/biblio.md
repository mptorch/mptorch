- [What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~david/courses/cs552/S12/handouts/goldberg-floating-point.pdf)
- [Numerical Computing with IEEE Floating Point Arithmetic](https://cosweb1.fau.edu/~jmirelesjames/ODE_course/Numerical_Computing_with_IEEE_Floating_Point_Arithmetic.pdf) by Michael Overton, first six chapters are a good tutorial-style introduction to floating-point numbers

## PyTorch and LLMs
- [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero): a nice and pedagogical introduction to PyTorch, DNN training and LLMs (you should definitely watch these and play with the code!)
